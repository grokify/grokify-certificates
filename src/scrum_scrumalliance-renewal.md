# The Value of Renewing Scrum Alliance Certifications (CSM and CSPO)

## TL;DR

Updating my Scrum Alliance Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certifications provided much more benefit than the anticipated pre-requisities for attending the Advacned level programs. Specifically, I gained the following:

1. Additional learnings and knkoweldge of the broad resources at ScrumAlliance.org, some of which I was already interested in learning more about.
1. A knowledge and appreciation of the people who take their time to write articles on Scrum.

In the end, I found it well worth the effort and time to get my certificates renewed.

This is what my certificate looked like when I received it in 2012:

And this is what it looked like in 2023 with the inactive notice. Of note, the design changed, but so much time had passed that an intermediate design had come and gone as well.

## The Decision

When I made the decision to renew my Scrum Alliance certificates, it had been over 10 years since I had attained them and while I had worked at multiple agile organizations in the intervening years, I had not found a reason to update them. However, times and situations change, and I found myself in an organization that was undergoing an agile transformation and I wanted to move ahead in my agile journey with Scrum Alliance.

I had attained both the Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) designations earlier and anted to move forward through the Advanced levels and to beyond. To do this, I needed to update my certicates, in the form of education and a fee. At first, I viewed this as a pre-requisite to taking the Advanced level programs, but I found out that, as with many things, the journey is more important than the destination, and I found a lot of value in gaining the required education described below.

## The Requirements

Once I made the decision to renew, I had to consider what it would take. At first, I was a bit concerned about this because of the amount of time that had lapsed and the requirement for 40 Scrum Education Units (SEUs) (20+20) for my CSM and CSPO certs. I was under the imporession this would be annual and was prepared to see what seemed like an insurmountable 400+ SEUs to renew my certs but not only did I only need 40, I received a 10 SEU discount by renewing both CSM and CSPO at the same time, so I only needed 30 SEUs.

Next, I looked at various ways to gain SEUs which included:

1. reading articles
1. watching videos
1. attending converents and meet ups
1. doing volunteer work

The way to get the most SEUs seemed to be to do volunteer work, however, volunteer Scrum work seemed to be in limited supply and had some lead time to accomplish.

In a similar fashion, attending conference and meet ups could take time.

So I started by watching videos and reading articles. At first I entered these in the Scrum Alliance website manually until I learned they could be automatically added which made the process much smoother.

## The Content

I ended up reading many articles and watching a few videos. The articles did extend my knowledge and appreciation of Scrum and Agile. In fact, some of the articles were ones that I would want to read on my own anyway. I ended up saving numerous articles for future reference, including the following:

## The Renewal

The Scrum Alliance dashboard provided a nice progress meter which was updated in near real-time after completing content on the website. Watching this meter indicated progress was moving faster than I thought it would be at 0.25 SEU per article.

By the time I renewed, my dashboard looked like the following:

And I was able to update my cert, which showed it was active again.

## The Community

The community built by Scrum Alliance is one of its strengths, from requiring classes to it's conferences and resources. To begin with, I appreciated the inclusion of the Certified Scrum Trainer names on the certificates. For me, my CSM trainer was [Michael James](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/mjames) and my CSPO trainer was [Chris Sims](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/csims).

In addition to the content, the renewal process allowed me to become familiar with many more members of Scrum Alliance by the the articles they wrote, some of which I listed above. It is great to see people participating in both writing articles and in the Scrum Alliance programs.

## Summary

Scrum Alliance has a focus on people including classes, conferences, content, and community. The certification renewal process requires Scrum Education Units (SEUs) which not only increases learning of content but of the community. I look forward to learning more through the organization and its members.
