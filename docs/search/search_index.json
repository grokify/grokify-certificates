This helps expand one's knowledge. I ended up reading many articles and watching some videos. I found that there were some topics that I was activly thinking about and others that got me to think about new topics. It took me about 3 weeks to get the 30 SEUs necessary to renew my CSM and CSPO designations. The Importance of the Community Scrum Alliance is a community-based organization where it is necessary to take classes and meet others in order to be certified. Community activities are also focused on in-person events rather than online forums. The Importance of the Certificate Scrum Trainer (CST) The classes held by the the ScrumAlliance are appreciated in that there is a human connection with the subject matter. A nice touch is that the name of the trainer (Certificate Scrum Trainer) is added to the certificates so it is easy to make the connection between the class and instructor, even many years later.
